# ðŸ“¦UV microscope enclosure
This would be the 1st prototype of building an enclosure for our UV microscope, this enclosure will fufil the minimum viable product (MVP):
- Panels to cover the side of the microscope
- A lid to cover the top and front of the microscope
## Proposed idea

*Figure 1. Acrylic panels for the enclosure*\
See 'DXF files' for the designs of the panels

*Figure 3. Since it was feedbacked that the hinge parts were difficult to identify, markings are added to the sides of the parts*\
See 'STL files" for 1 set of the hinges of each section 

Hinges are joined with a 3mm threaded rod
## Demonstration of opening/closing the lid

## Limitations/Improvements
- There are 4 different parts for 1 set of hinges which makes it troublesome for manufacturing â€”> change the design of the hinge so that there are fewer different parts/each section of the lid only requires 1 set of hinges
- Middle hinge buckle inwards into the microscope which causes confusion to the user on the way the lid should fold â€”> design a hinge that buckle outwards instead
- Opening lid is unintuitive for initial users â€”> change lid mechanism

That concludes this project ðŸŽº!
